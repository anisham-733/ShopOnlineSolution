Blazor WebAssembly and Web API on .NET 6 by building a shopping cart application using C#. 
Integrated a payment gateway into Blazor WebAssembly component, so that a user is able to pay for products through your application using a debit or credit card or PayPal account.

Basic approaches and Architecture
1. Create the Database using EF Core Code First Database Migrations
2. Retrieve Product Data from Database (Web API component)
3. Create Classes for Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)
4. Create ProductRepository Class (Repository Design Pattern)
5. Create ProductController Class
6. Create DtoConversion Class (DTO Conversion Extension methods)
7. Display Product Data to User (Blazor WebAssembly Component)
8. Display Data for Specific Product to User (Web API and Blazor)
9. Add Product to Shopping Cart (Web API and Blazor)
10. Remove Product from Shopping Cart (Web API and Blazor)
11. Update the Quantity of Products in the Shopping Cart (Web API, Blazor, Blazor JavaScript Interoperability)
12. Update the Header Menu in Response to a Change to the State of the Shopping Cart (Creating Custom Events in Blazor)
13. Integration of PayPal Payment Gateway into Blazor Component
14. Dynamically Populate the Side-Bar Menu (Web API and Blazor)
15. Optimise Code for Performance (Web API and Blazor)
16. Use Include Extension Method in LINQ Query (Web API)
17. User Local Storage Functionality (Blazor)
